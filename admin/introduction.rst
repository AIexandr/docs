Introduction
============

Veyon is a didactic software program, which was developed especially for computerwork
at schools. Nevertheless it can be used in other learning environments.

Veyon provides the opportunity to monitor and influence trainee activities and
consequently supports the work with modern technique in the classroom.

For example you are able to see the content of the trainee’s screens on your own
screen. If one of the trainees needs assistance, you can access the trainee’s desktop
and engage supportively. The trainee sees all of your actions and is so able to learn
new procedures.

If you have to make a new circumstance understandable for the trainee, you can
change to the demo-mode. The trainee has also the possibility to demonstrate
something. For this action it is necessary to click on his desktop screen to bypass his
screen to the screens of other trainees.

Veyon has other functions, too. Like locking the trainee screens, so that they are not
able to work any further and are constrained to give you attention.
